adaptit-tango-icons
===================

Tango icons from the Adapt It project

These are icons that I created for the open source Adapt It project (https://code.google.com/p/adaptit/).
I'm releasing them separately under a Public Domain license, in the off chance that someone finds them useful
outside the domain of translation software.

To get the icon set, you can either fork the code here or download the .zip from the [Project's page](http://eb1.github.io/adaptit-tango-icons/).

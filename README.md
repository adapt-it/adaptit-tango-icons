adaptit-tango-icons
===================

Tango icons from the Adapt It project

These are icons that I created for the open source Adapt It project (https://code.google.com/p/adaptit/).
I'm releasing them separately under a Public Domain license, in the off chance that someone finds them useful
outside the domain of translation software. Enjoy!
